# Territory Acknowledgement 

As a researcher and instructor at the University of Victoria, I acknowledge and respect the Lək̓ʷəŋən (Songhees and Esquimalt) Peoples on whose territory the university stands, and the Lək̓ʷəŋən and <u>W</u>SÁNEĆ Peoples whose historical relationships with the land continue to this day. I'm a settler scholar at UVic, and I arrived here as an uninvited guest in July 2011. 

In this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAgS8kOsjYY), Songhees Elder Elmer George welcomes visitors to the traditional lands of the Songhees, Esquimalt, and <u>W</u>SÁNEĆ people in lək̓ʷəŋən and English. The acknowledgement in this video was prepared in consultation with local Indigenous communities.

The fact that we're gathering at UVic to study media is a product of colonization and injustice upon local lands, waters, and people. I continue to learn about those injustices, and I will make no assumptions about your knowledge or experiences of them. As part of this course, I invite ongoing dialogue about territory acknowledgements and how UVic students, faculty, and staff are building good relations and fostering reciprocity. 

# Description

This course "surveys approaches to play and games around the world, from board and tabletop games to video games, alternate reality games and even sports." For more information, see ["MDIA360 - Game Studies"](https://www.uvic.ca/calendar/future/undergrad/index.php#/courses/view/654c0cc20d124d28da5f725c) in UVic's academic calendar. 

The course counts toward UVic's new [Media Studies](https://www.uvic.ca/calendar/future/undergrad/index.php#/programs/rJP4a8byi?bc=true&bcCurrent=Media%20Studies&bcItemType=programs) certificate, which requires 10.5 units of coursework. 

# Goals

I designed this course for you to: 

1. Build a vocabulary for playing and understanding games. This means you'll learn a lexicon for conversing with game critics and designers.  
2. Practice techniques for documenting play. This means you'll record it, write about it, and reflect on it. 
3. Account for context and culture in the analysis of games across the globe. This means we'll consider how, where, when, by whom, for whom, and under what assumptions games are made, played, and circulated. 
4. Respond directly to classroom activities and lectures about games. This means you'll complete three worksheets and one report to demonstrate what you're learning.  
5. Produce a multimodal argument about a game or Game Studies topic of your choice. This means you'll use video, audio, and/or images plus text to craft a public-facing essay by the end of term. 

I will assume you've no experience in Games Studies, and I will focus on critical approaches to games as they apply to content creation. Please note that this is not a Game History, History of Gaming, Game Preservation, or Game Design course. 

# About Me 

My name is Jentery Sayers (he / him). I skip a syllable and say it in two: "JEN-tree." You can call me Jentery, Doctor Sayers, or Professor Sayers. 

I spend 14.63% of the day looking for my glasses, and I enjoy writing about games and media. I grew up in Richmond, Virginia and went to Virginia Commonwealth University for my BA and BS degrees. Then I moved to Seattle, where I received an MA and PhD in English from the University of Washington. I now teach courses for UVic Media Studies and English, and I direct the Media Studies program. I like to play TTRPGs, drums, guitar, and soccer in my spare time. I also do my best to maintain a [portfolio](https://jntry.work/) of my work. 

You can email me at [jentery@uvic.ca](mailto:jentery@uvic.ca) or find me in Clearihue D331. My office hours are Monday and Thursday, 12-1pm, in CLE D331. I respond to emails Monday through Friday, 9am - 5pm, excluding holidays.

* Accept all your assignments (please don't submit anything to me by email), and
* Comment on those assignments and mark them.

# Assignments

There are no exams, quizzes, presentations, or participation marks in this course.

I am asking you to complete five assignments this term. 

1. **[Worksheet 1](https://jentery.github.io/mdia360v1/worksheet1.html)**: 20% of your final grade (due by Thursday, January 30th, at 1pm). 
2. **[Worksheet 2](https://jentery.github.io/mdia360v1/worksheet2.html)**: 20% of your final grade (due by Monday, February 24th, at 1pm). 
3. **[Worksheet 3](https://jentery.github.io/mdia360v1/worksheet3.html)**: 20% of your final grade (due by Monday, March 17th, at 1pm).
4. **[Genre Report](https://jentery.github.io/mdia360v1/report.html)**: 15% of your final grade (due by Monday, March 31st, at 1pm). 
5. **[Essay](https://jentery.github.io/mdia360v1/essay.html)**: 25% of your final grade (due by Thursday, April 17th, at 1pm). 

*Worksheets*: The worksheets will ask you to apply what you're learning in class through a combination of media (audio, images, text, and video). They will also scaffold your learning toward the final essay (see below). A worksheet will never contain more than three prompts, and I will encourage you to use class time to draft your brief responses to them. I will circulate each worksheet well before it's due, and I'll review each prompt in class to ensure it's clear. 

*Genre Report*: Near the end of term, you will work in a small group (4-6 people) to cover a genre of games that does not appear explicitly in the schedule below. Together, you will describe the genre as an activity and provide examples of its significance. I will encourage (but not require) your group to meet up (F2F or online) to play games in this genre. The prompt for this assignment will include a mechanism to help ensure equal contributions from each group member. 

*Final Essay*: For your final assignment, you will produce an essay about a game or Game Studies topic of your choice. You are welcome to select a game that does not appear on the above list (see "Games and Materials"), but please run it by me before commencing your research. You'll have two options: 1) a video essay of 10-14 minutes or 2) a written essay of 1250-2000 words plus images and/or audio. The worksheets in this course will scaffold your learning toward this essay (that way, you don't start it at the last minute), and I'll ask you to compose the essay with a public audience in mind (e.g., viewers of a specific channel or readers of a particular games website or magazine). I will also ask you to write at least some of the essay from the first-person perspective and include documentation of the game you played and how you played it. 

*Brightspace*: Please use Brightspace to submit all your work this term. You do not need to purchase any software to use Brightspace, but you will need your UVic NetLink ID, access to the internet, and a computer. I cannot accept assignments by email.

*Feedback*: I will provide brief and focused feedback on worksheets according to grading rubrics. Please email me or schedule an appointment (F2F or Zoom) to discuss my feedback. Again, I respond to emails Monday through Friday, 9am - 5pm, excluding holidays. Thanks in advance for your patience. 

# Workload

The most important thing to know about this course is that *I'll opt for care in every instance.* If the workload becomes too much or we're juggling more than we should, then I'll cut material. I planned for the maximum in advance, under the assumption we won't get to everything. And that's totally fine.

I suggest dedicating *3 to 5 hours* to MDIA 360 each week in addition to our weekly meetings on Monday and Thursday. Of course, 3 to 5 hours per week is only a guideline. You may find that you need more or less time depending on the activity, your preferences, and your familiarity with the materials and work involved.

I will give you some time during class to draft responses to the worksheets; however, you will need more time (between classes) to develop and refine your work, hence the recommended 3 to 5 hours per week. 

# Schedule

Here's the schedule for the term. It's subject to change. In fact, I'm 99.08% certain it will change. I will use a Brightspace announcement to notify you of those changes, and I will never use schedule changes to increase your workload (e.g., add an assignment or reading). 

All meetings are scheduled to occur in person (face-to-face). If you miss a class session or you simply want a review, then I recommend checking the class notebook for that session and touching base with a peer to see if they're willing to share their notes or audio recordings.

# Policies 

Here are the policies for this course alongside several UVic policies. Please let me know if anything is unclear, ignorant, or mistaken. I'll correct it. 

### Media Studies Certificate 

This course counts toward UVic's [Media Studies certificate](https://www.uvic.ca/calendar/future/undergrad/index.php#/programs/rJP4a8byi?bc=true&bcCurrent=Media%20Studies&bcItemType=programs).

### Communications and Office Hours

The best way to communicate with me is by email ([jentery@uvic.ca](mailto:jentery@uvic.ca)) or during office hours, which are Monday and Thursday, 12-1pm, in CLE D331. I can also make an appointment to meet with you in person or via Zoom. 

I respond to email between 9am and 5pm, Monday through Friday, excluding holidays. 
  
### Assessment and Feedback

One worksheet, the genre report, and the essay are required to pass this course. Failure to complete these three assignments will result in a failing N grade (calculated as a 0 for your GPA). 

I will use UVic's [official grading system](https://www.uvic.ca/calendar/future/undergrad/index.php#/policy/S1AAgoGuV?bc=true&bcCurrent=14%20-%20Grading&bcGroup=Undergraduate%20Academic%20Regulations&bcItemType=policies) to produce rubrics to assess your work. I will not post marks publicly or outside my office, and I do not use plagiarism or AI detection software.

All assignments should be submitted via Brightspace. I cannot accept them via email. 

I will use Brightspace to provide feedback on your work. If you ever want additional feedback, then feel free to ask me. I can provide it in person, via Zoom, or by email. 

Throughout the term, I'll request feedback from you on how the course is going. I'll also ask you to complete course experience surveys at the end of the term. 

### Late Submissions and Extensions

I've a 24-hour grace period (no questions asked, no email required, and no penalties) for every worksheet in this course. A late penalty of five points per business day will apply after 24 hours. Weekends and holidays do not count as business days. 

I will not accept worksheets more than two weeks after they are due and cannot accept the essay after April 23rd at 5pm. 

Please email me if you need an extension for any assignment, and we can discuss possibilities on a case-by-case basis.    

### Attendance and Participation

There is no participation or attendance mark in this course; however, every class session will rely heavily on discussion and interaction. 

I will assume you are attending each class meeting. If you are unable to attend a particular meeting, then please email me in advance and coordinate with a peer to get notes and the like from the session(s) you'll miss. 

*You do not need to provide me with documentation for an absence.*

### Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI)

I aim to create an inclusive learning environment that attends to difference and honours each of you, including your experiences at the intersections of race, ethnicity, gender, disability, sexuality, religion, power, and class. I want to be a resource for you, and I continue to learn about EDI. If something is said in class (by anyone, including me) that makes you feel uncomfortable, then don't hesitate to talk with me. If you have a name and/or set of pronouns that differ from those that appear in your university records, then let me know, and I'll correct the documents provided to me. If your performance in the class is being impeded by your experiences outside of class, then keep me posted, and we'll make adjustments. I also welcome any suggestions to improve the quality of the course, and I will make available mechanisms for anonymous feedback since you may prefer them.

### Information for All Students 

This [page](https://www.uvic.ca/calendar/future/undergrad/index.php#/content/64b07a85168098001c8e8a49) contains a list of important UVic policies.  

### Creating a Respectful, Inclusive, and Productive Learning Environment

UVic is committed to promoting critical academic discourse while providing a respectful and productive learning environment across all modalities of learning and teaching. All members of the university community have the right to experience, and the responsibility to help create, such an environment. In any course, the instructor has the primary responsibility for creating a respectful, inclusive and productive learning environment in a manner consistent with other university policies and regulations. Instructors or students who have unresolved questions or concerns about a particular learning environment should bring them to the Chair or Director of the unit concerned (or Dean, in the case of undepartmentalized faculties).

### Accessibility 

UVic commits to addressing and removing barriers that hinder full and equal participation of people with disabilities. UVic's [Accessibility Plan](https://www.uvic.ca/info/accessibility/index.php) includes guiding principles and existing resources. It summarizes consultations, barriers, and priorities for the next three years to address those barriers.

### Equity Action Plan 

[The Equity Action Plan](https://www.uvic.ca/equity-action-plan/index.php)'s goals provide UVic with strategic direction to advance equity, diversity, and inclusion, and to create the conditions in which everyone feels a sense of belonging: as connected and respected parts of the university community.

### Sexualized Violence Prevention and Response 

UVic's [Sexualized Violence Resource Office](https://www.uvic.ca/sexualizedviolence/) in Equity and Human Rights (EQHR) offers information on how to start the conversation about consent, where to get support on and off campus, and the options available under UVic’s Sexualized Violence Prevention and Response Policy.

### Accommodation of Religious Observance 

UVic recognizes its obligation to make reasonable accommodation for students whose observance of holy days might conflict with the academic requirements of a course or program. Students are permitted to absent themselves from classes, seminars, or workshops for the purposes of religious or spiritual observance. In the case of compulsory classes or course events, students will normally be required to provide reasonable notice to their instructors of their intended absence from the class or event for reasons of religious or spiritual observance. In consultation with the student, the instructor will determine an appropriate means of accommodation. The instructor may choose to reschedule classes or provide individual assistance. Where a student's participation in a class event is subject to grading, every reasonable effort will be made to allow the student to make up for the missed class through alternative assignments or in subsequent classes. Students who require a rescheduled examination must give reasonable notice to their instructors. If a final exam cannot be rescheduled within the regular exam period, students may request an academic concession.

### Student Conduct

UVic is committed to promoting a safe, respectful and supportive learning, living, and working environment. As part of the university community, each student is responsible for their personal conduct as it affects the university community, university activities, and the university's property. [The Office of Student Life](https://www.uvic.ca/services/studentlife/student-conduct/index.php) works directly with the university community to review and help resolve non-academic student conduct concerns. They administer the university's Resolution of Non-Academic Misconduct Allegations policy and serve as a supportive resource to the university community.

### Non-Academic Student Conduct 

UVic's [Non-Academic Misconduct Allegations policy](https://www.uvic.ca/services/studentlife/student-conduct/non-academic-misconduct/index.php?utm_medium=redirect&utm_source=namc&utm_campaign=redirect-usage) (AC1300) clarifies what non-academic student misconduct is; details how the university responds to non-academic misconduct allegations; outlines the review and investigation processes; describes possible outcomes and ensures that when misconduct is found to have occurred, any sanctions that are applied are fair and consistent; and, explains how to appeal a decision that has been made under the policy.

### Academic Integrity  

[Academic integrity](https://www.uvic.ca/calendar/future/undergrad/index.php#/policy/Sk_0xsM_V) requires commitment to the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect, and responsibility. It is expected that students, faculty members, and staff at the University of Victoria, as members of an intellectual community, will adhere to these ethical values in all activities related to learning, teaching, research, and service. Any action that contravenes this standard, including misrepresentation, falsification, or deception, undermines the intention and worth of scholarly work and violates the fundamental academic rights of members of our community. This policy is designed to ensure that the university's standards are upheld in a fair and transparent fashion.

Students are responsible for the entire content and form of their work. Nothing in this policy is intended to prohibit students from developing their academic skills through the exchange of ideas and the utilization of resources available at the university to support learning (e.g., The Centre for Academic Communication). Students who are in doubt as to what constitutes a violation of academic integrity in a particular instance should consult their course instructor.

### Copyright 

All course materials, including my slides, handouts, and lectures, are made available for educational purposes and the exclusive use of students in this course. The material is protected under copyright law even if it is not marked as such, and the syllabus is licensed [CC BY-NC 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/). Any further use or distribution of materials to others requires written permission, except under fair dealing or another exception in the Copyright Act. Violations may result in disciplinary action under the Resolution of Non-Academic Misconduct Allegations policy (AC1300). 

### Generative AI 

UVic encourages innovative teaching practices and supports instructors who may like to adopt new pedagogical approaches and learning technologies. Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is a form of machine learning with the capabilities to produce text, images, video, music, code, etc. UVic does not have a general ban on the use of GAITs, including ChatGPT. Instead, UVic embraces the appropriate and ethical use of GAITs in learning and teaching. The university recognizes potential concerns associated with the use of GAITs, including potential biases in the algorithms and the possibility that GenAI might be used in ways that violate academic integrity principles and intellectual property rights. Faculty and instructors are best positioned to make decisions about the use of GAITs in their courses. UVic offers [guidelines](https://teachanywhere.uvic.ca/academic-integrity/ai-evaluation/) to support faculty, instructors, and students in the responsible, effective, and ethical use of artificial intelligence tools. These guidelines also support principles of academic integrity and help to prepare students for a future where the use of GAITs continues to evolve.

### Basic Needs 

I want you to thrive in this course and everywhere else. Please let me know as early as possible if you have any concerns or if you require any supports to succeed. I'll do my best to help. If, for instance, you need to cover gaps in care, then please don't hesitate to bring your children to class meetings. Babies who are nursing are always welcome, as I do not want you to choose between feeding your child and continuing your education.
