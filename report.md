# Genre Report

The Genre Report covers course material since January 9th ("Work and Play"). Your response is due via Brightspace by Monday, March 31st, at 1pm.

This assignment is *open-book*, meaning you are allowed to use the course website, the class notebook, your own notes, recordings of class sessions, the library, and the internet to address the prompts.

*Please cite your source material.*

## The Prompt 

In a group of 3 to 6 people, please identify a genre of games that does not appear on the MDIA 360 course schedule. Then produce a brief report on the significance of that genre to Game Studies. Feel free to focus on one or multiple game formats (board, card, tabletop, or video games). 

You should: 

* **Responsibility 1**: Write a summary of the genre as an activity system: its conventions, what players expect of it, what it prompts players to do, and what kinds of uptake are either common or unique in it (250 words). 
* **Responsibility 2**: Identify and describe a game that serves as a quintessential demonstration of the genre (250 words plus documentation).
* **Responsibility 3**: Identify and describe another game that serves as a quintessential demonstration of the genre (250 words plus documentation).
* **Responsibility 4**: Write a statement explaining why the genre should appear on the MDIA 360 course schedule (100 words). Compile the report, copy-edit it (tracking your changes), and use the class notebook to circulate it to the class (including me). Create a representative slide, image, or video for your report and share it with me before class ends on Thursday, March 27th. (I will project it in class on Monday, March 31st.) Finally, ensure the entire group has a copy of the final report to submit via Brightspace. 
* **Responsibility 5 (for groups of 5)**: Identify and describe yet another game that serves as a quintessential demonstration of the genre (250 words plus documentation). 
* **Responsibility 6 (for groups of 6)**: Identify and describe yet another game that serves as a quintessential demonstration of the genre (250 words plus documentation).

Each group member should assume responsibility for one of the above tasks. I've numbered them for your convenience. Recall that every game involves multiple genres ("genre sets"). Here, I'm asking you to focus on one at a time. 

At the bottom of your report, please identify (by name) which student assumed which of the above responsibilities. Please note that group members will not be penalized in cases where a student does not fulfill their responsibility. 

**Reflection**: Once you've complete the Genre Report, please use 250 words to reflect on what you learned from it and the process of contributing to it. Be sure to address the responsibility you assumed for the Report. 

*The Genre Report should be polished. Please take time to review and copy-edit it for clarity and consistency.*

## Assessment 

I will use the following rubric, based on [UVic's official grading system](https://www.uvic.ca/calendar/undergrad/index.php#/policy/S1AAgoGuV?bc=true&bcCurrent=14%20-%20Grading&bcGroup=Undergraduate%20Academic%20Regulations&bcItemType=policies), to assess your responses. 

* 89.5-100 (exceeds all expectations): the report is  compelling; it addresses all the prompt and applies course terminology; it enhances the course material, including lectures, class discussions, the class notebook, and our engagements with games listed in the syllabus; the use of examples is clear, focused, convincing, and inventive (original insight)
* 79.5-89 points (exceeds some or most expectations): the report is compelling; it addresses the prompt and applies course terminology; it corresponds with the course material, including lectures, class discussions, the class notebook, and our engagements with games listed in the syllabus; the use of examples is clear, focused, and convincing 
* 69.5-79 points (meets or mostly meets the expectations): the report addresses the prompt and applies course terminology; it corresponds with the course material, including lectures, class discussions, the class notebook, and our engagements with games listed in the syllabus; the use of examples is often convincing but may warrant some clarification
* 59.5-69 points (meets some expectations): the report addresses some of the prompt and applies some course terminology; it corresponds with some of the course material, including lectures, class discussions, the class notebook, and our engagements with games listed in the syllabus; the use of examples warrants some clarification
* 49.5-59 points (does not meet the expectations): the report does not correspond much, if at all, with the course material or the prompt
* 0-49 points: no report or an incomplete report

1 point will be deducted for every 25 words over the prescribed word count. 

10 points will be deducted from the overall mark if no references are included at the end of the report (see "Citing Your Sources").

5 points will be deducted from the overall mark if the references at the end of the report are not formatted according to an established citation style (see "Citing Your Sources").

Your mark for the Genre Report will constitute 15% of your final mark in this course. 

*You do not need to meet the word count in each section to earn a high mark.* 

I recommend using prose (paragraphs) rather than point form in your report. Prose is more synthetic and will allow you to make connections.

## Citing Your Sources 

Please do not forget to cite any material from which you draw ideas or examples. This includes games, videos, podcasts, and streams as well as academic publications such as monographs and journal articles. You are welcome to use your preferred citation style (MLA, Chicago, or APA, e.g.).  

## What to Submit 

Please submit a DOCX, ODT, PAGES, or PDF file containing your answers and references along with any media files you were prompted to attach or embed. 

## When to Submit It

The Genre Report is due by 1pm on Monday, March 31st, but there is a 24-hour grace period. I will deduct five points for every business day I receive the Genre Report after 1pm on Tuesday, April 1st. I will close the submission portal for the Genre Report at 1pm on Monday, April 14th, and cannot accept any submissions after the portal is closed. I do not accept any submissions by email.
