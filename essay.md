# Final Essay (DRAFT) 

Your Final Essay is due via Brightspace by Thursday, April 17th, at 1pm.

You will produce an essay about a game or Game Studies topic of your choice. You are welcome to select a game that does not appear [here](https://jentery.github.io/mdia360v1/index.html#games-and-materials), but please run it by me before commencing your research. 

You'll have two options: 1) a video essay of 10-14 minutes or 2) a written essay of 1250-2000 words plus images and/or audio. 

The worksheets in this course will scaffold your learning toward this essay (that way, you don’t start it at the last minute), and I’ll ask you to compose the essay with a public audience in mind (e.g., viewers of a specific channel or readers of a particular games website or magazine). I will also ask you to write at least some of the essay from the first-person perspective and include documentation of the game you played and how you played it.

The complete prompt for the final essay is coming soon. For now, please let me know what questions, concerns, or suggestions you have. I'd like to integrate them with the final prompt. Thank you!
